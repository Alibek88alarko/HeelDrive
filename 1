Proposal Description *
HeelDrive is an innovative enhancement to conventional floor-mounted accelerator pedals. It integrates a heel-activated switch, allowing the driver to instantly engage pre-configured driving functions such as downshifts, driving mode changes, or special vehicle modes — all through intuitive heel pressure.
Unlike traditional kick-down systems, HeelDrive separates acceleration and control functions, enhancing ergonomics and ensuring faster access to critical functions.
Its simple mechanical design allows low-cost integration into existing pedal assemblies, making it attractive for both mass-market vehicles and performance cars.
Why is this relevant for Bosch? *
Bosch is a global leader in automotive pedal assemblies, sensors, and control systems. HeelDrive offers Bosch an opportunity to enhance its existing pedal solutions by adding an intuitive heel-operated control feature, improving driver-vehicle interaction and responsiveness.
This innovation supports Bosch’s goals of delivering innovative, driver-focused components that enhance safety, comfort, and driving dynamics. HeelDrive fits into both standard and premium vehicle segments, offering additional value to OEM customers.
What makes your Innovation unique? *
Unlike conventional kick-down functions that rely on toe pressure alone, HeelDrive introduces a dedicated heel input, allowing the driver to instantly trigger downshifts, mode changes, or other functions without removing hands from the steering wheel.
HeelDrive requires no new dashboard buttons or controls — it works entirely through natural foot positioning, ensuring intuitive, distraction-free operation.
Its simplicity, ease of integration, and ergonomic benefits make it uniquely positioned to enhance both driving performance and comfort.
